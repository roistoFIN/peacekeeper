# Peacekeeper Branding Guidelines

## Core Philosophy
Peacekeeper is a "self-help conflict coaching" tool. The visual identity must balance two opposing needs:
1.  **Urgency:** The "SOS" function must be instantly accessible and recognizable during high-stress moments.
2.  **Calm:** The overall aesthetic must be soothing, reducing cognitive load and promoting regulation (down-regulating the nervous system).

## Color Palette

### Primary: "Safety Blue"
Used for headers, icons, and primary UI elements.
- **Name:** Blue Grey
- **Hex:** `#607D8B` (Material Blue Grey 500)
- **Meaning:** Stability, neutrality, calm, professionalism.

### Accent: "Emergency Red"
Reserved *strictly* for the SOS/Action buttons to cut through the noise.
- **Name:** Red 700
- **Hex:** `#D32F2F`
- **Meaning:** Stop, Pay Attention, Help.

### Background: "Canvas White"
- **Hex:** `#FFFFFF` or `#F5F5F5` (Grey 100)
- **Meaning:** Clarity, breathability.

## Typography
- **Headings:** Clean, sans-serif, bold but not aggressive.
- **Body:** Readable, high contrast, generous line height (1.5x) to aid reading under stress.

## Logo: " The Shield & Dove"
The logo represents protection (a shield) and peace (a stylized bird/dove form) created by two converging shapes (representing the couple).
