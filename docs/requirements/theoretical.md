## Theoretical Backgroud for Application

In a conflict situation, cognitive capacity is reduced, the limbic system is activated, and long-form reflective tasks do not work. Therefore, the application must **guide**, not teach.

All models used in the core framework are well-known and widely accepted. The application does not promise treatment, but positions itself as **“self-help conflict coaching.”** The app does not interpret the user; it guides a structured process.

## Core Theoretical Framework

### 1. Gottman Institute – *Flooding & Repair*

This is the most widely recognized and easiest to justify framework.

Key elements implemented in the app:

* Detection of physiological overwhelm
* Taking a pause (“time-out”)
* Repair attempts

**App’s role:**

> “I notice that the situation has escalated. Let’s slow this down.”

---

### 2. Nervous System Regulation (Polyvagal Theory)

Understanding that when a person is in a *fight-or-flight* state, logical reasoning is impaired.
The app’s task is to guide users back into a *social engagement* state.

### 3. EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy)

Emotion before problem-solving is the gold standard in couples therapy.

Core principle:

* The conflict itself is not the problem → **emotion and insecurity are**

Implemented in the app as:

* Naming emotions (predefined options, no free text)
* Prompt: *“What do I actually need right now?”*

### 4. Nonviolent Communication (NVC) – Structure for Expression

Provides a clear, algorithmic structure:

1. Observation (no interpretation)
2. Emotion
3. Need
4. Request

This structure is used for guided dialogue.

### 5. CBT-lite – Interrupting Cognitive Distortions

Using brief stopping questions:

* “Am I certain about this interpretation?”
* “Is my partner bad, or simply different from me?”

## Guided Expression – Design Rationale

Guided expression is the **most critical component of the application**.
It must be:

* Easy
* Safe
* Sufficiently directive, but not therapeutic

Full NVC is too heavy, requires training, and is frustrating during conflict.
Therefore, the app uses **NVC-lite**.

The purpose is to:

* Remove impulsive language
* Give the speaker the experience of *“being heard”*
* Give the listener a clear, bounded role
* Prevent the conversation from derailing
